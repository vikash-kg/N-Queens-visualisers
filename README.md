# N-Queens-visualisers
The N-Queens Visualizer is a tool designed to help users understand and solve the classic N-Queens problem visually. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This visualizer provides an interactive interface where users can specify the board size (N) and watch as the solution is generated or manually place queens on the board. Additionally, users can visualize the backtracking algorithm step by step, gaining insight into how the solution is derived.
